# Cleric: Music Domain

*Just as the Bards tell stories about the profane world, the Clerics
of the Music Domain are tasked with spreading the word about the
divine and holy. Most Music Domain Clerics have no home, wandering
between settlements, regions and even realms to spread the word about
their god. With divine help, they are able to shape the sounds of
their instruments and their voice in many ways. Their friends and
allies know their divine music as harmonious songs, but if need be,
the Clerics can produce the twisted and jarring sounds capable of
inflicting mental and physical hurt.*

Appropriate Cantrips: (Thunder Clap, Booming Blade,) Toll the Dead

### Bonus Proficiency
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Performance (Cha) skill.

### Servant of Sound
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in one musical instrument of
your choice. You may use any musical instrument you are proficient
with as holy symbol.

### Distracting Noise.
At 1st level, when a creature within 10ft of you takes the attack
action, you can use your reaction to produce a loud clanging or
screeching sound, confusing the creature. The creature must make
a wisdom saving throw against your Spell DC if it can hear the
sound. On a failed save, the creature makes all attacks at
disadvantage until the end of its next turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when
you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Wave of Music
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to
produce a forceful musical wave, amplified by your god's might.
As an action, choose one of the following effects: 
- Chaotic Chime. From your holy symbol, an unpleasant,
distressing sound is released in a 30ft cone, piercing the mind
of all who are in its way. Every creature in the cone must make
a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d8 psychic
damage and drop anything they are holding. On a successful save,
they take half as much damage.
- Soothing Song. A pleasant melody eminates from your holy symbol
and invigorates the creatures around you. Every creature in a 15ft
radius centered on yourself gains +5 to its AC until the end of
your next turn and regains 2d6+WisMod hit points.

### Grand Hymn
Starting at 6th level, you can sing a hymn or ballad as an action,
praising your god or telling wonderful stories. Creatures who can
hear it gather around you to listen in awe, and through your god's
might, every creature can understand your singing, even if you don't
share a language. All hearing creatures in a 30ft radius must use
their movement to move towards you, unless they are hostile or have
an urgent task. If a creature is hostile toward you or has an urgent
task to do and hears your hymn, it must make a wisdom saving throw
against your Spell DC. On a successful save, it is not affected by 
the hymn. On a failed save, it must use its movement to move towards
you and a hostile creature becomes neutral towards you and your allies.
Any creature that made a saving throw initially will repeat that saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it will shake off
the effects of the hymn. Any creature becomes unaffected if it leaves
the 30ft radius or if it or its allies are attacked by you or your 
allies. Once a creature has broken free from the effect, it can not
fall under the effect again during this use of the ability.
You must use your Bonus Action to keep playing the hymn during the
duration. The hymn ends after one minute, or when you fail a
concentration save (as if you were casting a spell.)
You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your
proficiency bonus, rounded down (minimum of once). You regain all
expended uses after a long rest.

### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
the discordant power of cacophony. Once on each of your turns when you
hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal
an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level,
the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Perfect Piece
At 17th level, infused with the power of your god, you can use your
Channel Divinity to produce a more powerful yet controlled wave of
music. Within a 30ft radius centered on you, creatures are moved by
your song. For each creature individually, choose one of the following
effects:
- Crushing Cacophony. A terrible, jarring dissonance tears through the
creature's brain, wounding its mind and its body. It must make a wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d8 psychic damage and 4d8
thunder damage, and is stunned. On a successful save, they take half as
much damage of each type and is not stunned. Every stunned target makes
a constitution saving throw against your spell DC, ending the condition
on itself on success.
- Symphonic Salvation. Beautiful music surrounds the creature, healing
physical and spiritual wounds. It regains 4d6+WisMod hit points and gains
4d6 temporary hit points. It also gains 4+1d4 to its AC until the end of
your next turn.
- Ignorant Indifference. The creature is unaffected.
